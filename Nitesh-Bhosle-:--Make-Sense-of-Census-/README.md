After completing this project, now i have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, i am applying the following concepts:

Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation




### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project i used Numpy and vectorization concepts (and functions) to complete it


### Challenges faced
